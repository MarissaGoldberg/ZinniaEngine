# Zinnia Engine: The Blooming Terminal Engine
Combining The Best From The New And The Old

### Description
Zinnia is a new game engine aiming to be the "best" terminal game engine.
To do so, it embraces modern tools and philosophy.
It does not fear change, blooming once again after every cut, every refactor, glowing stronger.

We firmly believe that having less emphasis on graphics/visuals and more on gameplay will lead to games that have more depth in them.
Whether these games will be more or less fun is up for debate. Nonetheless... let's be crazy.

### Goals
* Accessible/Inclusive: As many people as possible should be able to play games made with Zinnia. That also goes for the community, hate will not be tolerated in any form.
* Flexible: It should be as easy as possible to adapt to whatever your needs are, even if they are in Anti-Goals.
* Blooms every trim: Embraces change through quick iteration. Is not scared of breaking things. For stability, use a release or fixed git hash.
* Simple inputs: Supports any input in the form of a key press, usually a keyboard. (Almost anything can be mapped to keyboard keys.)
* Simple render: Renders a 2d grid of symbols + properties (color, bold, flashing, etc).
* Multiplayer: Supports anything from single player to 100,000+ players/bots.
* Game types: Realtime, wait-for-key and fixed update modes.

### Anti-Goals
* Minimalism: Minimalism has value in a lot of places, but is also exclusive. Accessibility matters more than ideology.
* 2d Tiles, 3d: Zinnia is meant to run in terminals. If you want fancier graphics, write/use a library mapping the 2d grid to "fancy" graphics.
* Monetization: Not interested in money and never will be. Capitalism corrupts passion and commodifies it. It will not happen here.
* Staying in our corner: This is an opportunity to reclaim the passion that was lost in game dev. Forsake pretty graphics. Embrace crazy gameplay. Aim for fun for both you and the players! Create communities!
